        <h3>Using Go at Google</h3>
        <p>
          Go was created at Google in 2007, and since then, engineering teams
          across Google have adopted Go to build products and services at
          massive scale.

        <h3>Go 1.18 beta</h3>
        <p>
          We are encouraged by all the excitement around Go's upcoming 1.18
          release, which adds support for generics, fuzzing, and the new Go
          workspace mode. We released Go 1.18 beta 1 two months ago, and it is
          now the most downloaded Go beta ever, with twice as many downloads as
          any previous release. Beta 1 has also proved very reliable; in fact,
          we are already running it in production here at Google. Your feedback
          on Beta 1 helped us identify obscure bugs in the new support for
          generics and ensure a more stable final release. We've resolved these
          issues in today's release of Go 1.18 Beta 2, and we encourage everyone
          to try it out. The easiest way to install it alongside your existing
          Go toolchain is to run
